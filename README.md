# aws_dms_task_status_exporter

This is an exporter for monitor status of AWS DMS replication tasks.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

This project requires installed in your machine the Python 3.7 and pip.

With that packages, you will need to install some libs for the project, to install then, use the follow command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now you have all the dependencies :)

### Installing

To run locally, you need all prerequisites installed.

Before execute, create a yaml file, with all replication tasks id you want to monitor the status, you could modify or base your yaml in `example.yml`.

This project uses three environment variables, which you need to create, the envs are:
* AWS_ACCESS_KEY (access key with dms read permissions)
* AWS_SECRET_KEY (secret key)
* AWS_REGION (Optional/May be declared in yaml file as `region`)

Now to execute the exporter, just run:

```
python exporter.py --file example.yml
```

Case you prefer run in docker, build the image and run the container:

```
docker build -t aws_dms_task_status_exporter .
```

```
docker run -itd --name exporter -p 9213:9213 -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY="<AWS_ACCESS_KEY>" -e AWS_SECRET_KEY="<AWS_SECRET_KEY>" -e REGION="<REGION>" aws_dms_task_status_exporter:latest
```

To see the metrics, you can access: 
`localhost:9213/metrics`
